"""Deleting an employee must not be able to remove the org's last admin.

employee_archive / employee_bulk_archive already refuse to archive the last
active superuser. employee_delete / employee_bulk_delete had no equivalent
check at all -- a lone admin could delete their own account (or someone else
could delete it for them) with nothing to stop it, permanently, with no
undo the way archiving has. A customer hit exactly this: deleted their own
employee profile, which cascaded into deleting their own login, and was
locked out with no admin account left on the instance.

These tests pin the same protection on the delete path.
